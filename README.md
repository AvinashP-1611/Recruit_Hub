     - State management: React Context API or Redux.

### Backend:

**1. Technical Architecture:**
   - **Objective:**
     - Implement scalable server to handle business logic like add user, admin, recruiter and candidate details  and interact with the database.

   - **Technology Stack:**
     - Java(SpringBoot) (Backend Framework)

**2. Database:**
   - **Objective:**
     - Choose a relational database for storing user data, client information, and job descriptions.

     - MySQL (Relational Database)

**3. Authentication Module:**
   - **Objective:**
     - Ensure secure user access control.

   - **Technology Stack:**
     - Authentication for frontend 
     - Validate tokens on the backend using JWT token

**4. JD Parsing Module:**
